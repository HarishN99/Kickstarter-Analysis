# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

- Explain the purpose of this analysis:

This analysis was intended to help Louise begin and plan her crowdfunding campaign to help fund her play Fever by determining specific factors or trends that make a project’s campaign successful. Specifically, this analysis helps visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and funding goals. This will provide Louise with information on how launch dates and funding goals may be influencing the success of crowdfunding campaigns so that she can set her own campaign accordingly. 


## Analysis and Challenges

Explain how you performed your analysis using images and links to code, as well as any challenges you encountered and how you overcame them. 

If you had no challenges, describe any possible challenges or difficulties that could be encountered.


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

In the analysis, I spent a little extra time with the COUNTIFS formula because I realized the trends in chart and pivot table did not make sense conceptually with the numbers in the dataset. I found the trends on the chart also did not match with the chart on the challenge instructions, so I decided to check my formula on excel. After some troubleshooting, I found that I had specified the formula to check numerical values in the “pledged” column (Column E) rather than the goals column (Column D). I believe I encountered this challenge because I typed in these column values rather than moving from sheet to sheet and selecting the columns when writing the formula.  Ultimately, it was a quick fix, and I found the chart matched the overall data appropriately after I made the changes. 


## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
